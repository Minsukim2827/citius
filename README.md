# Citius App
Citius App is a simple memory game developed in Java using the Swing library for GUI. The game uses a grid of buttons that flash in a particular sequence. The player's task is to remember the sequence and reproduce it by clicking the buttons in the correct order. The game includes a timer and keeps track of the player's score.

## Getting Started

## How to Play
When you start the game, a sequence of colors will flash on the grid.
Your task is to reproduce this sequence by clicking the buttons in the correct order.
If you reproduce the sequence correctly, your score will increase, and a new sequence will be displayed.
If you reproduce the sequence incorrectly, the game will show the correct sequence again and you'll have another chance to reproduce it.
The game ends when the timer runs out. Your score will be displayed at the end.
